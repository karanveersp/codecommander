Learning python is easier than other languages for many reasons. One of the reasons is the tremendous amount of great, free resources to learn from.
So here are some resources I found heplful.

## Books
- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) - Shows how to write useful programs to do all sorts of things with python.
- [Composing Programs](https://composingprograms.com/) - A python oriented take on the legendary [_SICP_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs) book/course.
- [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html) - Get immersed in the details.
- [Learn Python](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/) - Fastest introduction to python if you have programmed in other languages.

## Videos
- [Corey Schafer's Beginning Python Programming Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg&list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7) - Python centric channel that has lots of quality content from basics to advanced concepts.
- [Derek Banas's Learn Python in One Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4mEzFDjqtA) - Efficient and to the point.


I also learned quite a bit about Python and REST API development through [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-api-flask-and-python/) amazing Udemy course. Highly recommend you grab it on one of the periodic sales.
