And so another exciting, insightful journey begins. This is a programming blog for me to share code tutorials with the world.

Programming is a very joyful and rewarding activity that anyone can learn. All you need is an interest in solving puzzles and a curiosity for exploring the mind of a computer!

So lets get this underway. We’ll begin with a simple hello world program in the Python programming language.

Go to this site to download the latest version of [python 3](https://www.python.org/)

Once installed, go to the command prompt and type ```python```. You should see the python interpreter open up.

```bash
Python 3.7.2 (tags/v3.7.2:9a3ffc0492, Dec 23 2018, 23:09:28) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

See the three chevrons `>>>` ? That's python waiting for you to tell it what to do! You can type basic *expressions* like `1+1` or `49/64` and the python interpretor will evaluate them. 

Now, you are ready to issue your first command to your computer! How exciting!

Type the following statement and press return.

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

You’ll see Hello World! printed just below. It might seem like a very simple thing but many interesting things were going on underneath the hood when this command was issued. We’ll soon learn how the python interpreter works and what your commands really mean to a machine that only thinks in 1s and 0s.

Welcome to the exciting world of computer programming!
