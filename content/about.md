Hi there

My name is Karanveer and I'm the author of this blog.

I'm a software developer who enjoys working with many languages. Currently, I'm working with Python with a little bit of Java.

Having learned so much from others, this blog is my effort to share what I know with the world.

You can find my github page [here](https://github.com/karanveersp).

I also have a deep interest in drawing and painting and you can see some of my sketches on [this instagram page](https://instagram.com/karanveer41).

So, there you have it... enjoy!
