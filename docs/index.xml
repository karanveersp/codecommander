      <description>Hi there
My name is Karanveer and I&amp;rsquo;m the author of this blog.
I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer who enjoys working with many languages. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m working with Python with a little bit of Java.
Having learned so much from others, this blog is my effort to share what I know with the world.
You can find my github page here.
I also have a deep interest in drawing and painting and you can see some of my sketches on this instagram page.</description>
